How to Complile and run our program:
    - Extract the bera0041_addep011_Project3.zip file
    - Node.java has to be implemented with proper instance variables, getters and setters for LinkedList to work
    - To implement a linked list, use the proper structure LinkedList<datatype> <name>= new LinkedList<>()
    - This allows to work with a linked list and use the list methods for a linked list
    - To implement an array list, use the proper structure ArrayList<datatype> <name>= new ArrayList<>()
    - This allows to work with an array list and use the list methods

	NOTE: Node.java is not included in submission. For LinkedList to work, Node.java has to be implemented with proper instance variables, getters and setters.
	NOTE: For the tests to work, the tests have to be moved to the same directory as the other files and then executed.



Contributions of each partner:

    - Tamojit Bera:
          - LinkedList.java

    - Srinivas Preetham Addepalli:
          - ArrayList.java



Assumptions:

    - Tests are run on IntelliJ
    - Printing LinedList and ArrayList calls the toString method, which prints ONLY the elements in their respective positions, with each element in a new line
    - in the LinkedList, the first node is a header node whose data is null, and it is ignored while printing the list
